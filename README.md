### [Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc) 👋

My name is Jakub Duchniewicz (although I have many nicknames wherever I go :)). I am a programmer, electronics and embedded thingies developer, with working experience in GameDev and Game Engines in particular. I am currently doing working at Tietoevry on 5G FlexRAN networks. Also, pursuing my master thesis on Embedded Systems MSc at University of Turku, Finland and KTH Royal Academy in Stockholm, Sweden with a minor in Innovation and Enterpreneurship. 

I am passionate about optimizations and writing code which is utilizing the underlying hardware at its best. In my free time I write blog posts about things I am doing - [check them out](https://jduchniewicz.com/posts/)!

I frequently attend Game Jams where I can unleash my creative self, meet amazing people and chill. Apart from that you can meet me at surfing 🏄‍♂️, kitesurfing 🪁 and windsurfing spots 🤙. I also happen to do some skiing both on and off-piste ⛷️
