### [Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc) 👋

My name is Jakub Duchniewicz (although I have many nicknames wherever I go :)). I am a programmer, electronics and embedded thingies developer, with working experience in GameDev and Game Engines in particular. I am currently studying Embedded Systems MSc at University of Turku, Finland and KTH Royal Academy in Stockholm, Sweden with a minor in Innovation and Enterpreneurship. 

I am passionate about optimizations and writing code which is utilizing the underlying hardware at its best. In my free time I write blog posts about things I am doing - [check them out](https://jduchniewicz.com/posts/)!

I frequently attend Game Jams where I can unleash my creative self, meet amazing people and chill. Apart from that you can meet me at surfing 🏄‍♂️, kitesurfing 🪁 and windsurfing spots 🤙. I also happen to do some skiing both on and off-piste ⛷️
