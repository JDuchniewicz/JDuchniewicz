### Hello there 👋

My name is Jakub Duchniewicz (although I have many nicknames wherever I go :)). I am a programmer, electronics and embedded thingies developer, with some experience with GameDev and Game Engines in particular. I am currently studying Embedded Systems MSc at University of Turku, Finland. I am passionate about optimizations and writing code which is utilizing the underlying hardware at its best. Recently I have been doing some tech-blogging.

I frequently attend Game Jams where I can unleash my creative self, meet amazing people and chill. Apart from that you can probably meet me at surfing, kitesurfing and windsurfing spots.
