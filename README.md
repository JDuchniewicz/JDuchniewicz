### [Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc) 👋

My name is Jakub Duchniewicz (although I have many nicknames wherever I go :)). I am a programmer, electronics and embedded thingies developer, with working experience in GameDev and Game Engines in particular. I am currently working at Tietoevry on 5G FlexRAN networks leading a team of talented engineers. 

I have just recently graduated with MSc in Embedded Systems at University of Turku, Finland and KTH Royal Academy in Stockholm, Sweden with a minor in Innovation and Enterpreneurship. My thesis was titled *"FPGA accelerated tcpdump with eBPF"* and is available for viewing [here](https://jduchniewicz.com/FPGA-capture.pdf) and the repository is located [here](https://github.com/JDuchniewicz/de0-nano-soc-starter).

I am passionate about optimizations and writing code which is utilizing the underlying hardware at its best. In my free time I write blog posts about things I am doing - [check them out](https://jduchniewicz.com/posts/)!

I frequently attend Game Jams where I can unleash my creative self meet amazing people and chill. I am a proud co-founder of [Sticky Piston Studios](https://github.com/Sticky-Piston-Studios) where we recently published ["The Deluge"](https://hist0r.itch.io/the-deluge) which won HackYeah 2022 competition. 

Apart from that you can meet me at surfing 🏄‍♂️, kitesurfing 🪁 and windsurfing spots 🤙. I also happen to do some skiing both on and off-piste ⛷️

- 🏢 I am currently working on the deployment of 5G networks (FlexRAN L1 and L2 development) at Tietoevry and making them run fast 🏃
- 📖 I am also learning on how to reverse engineer and do teensy-weensy IoT hacking 🤖 
- 🌱 Right now I am learning about hardware hacking, reverse engineering and embedded Rust. I would love to one day design my personal ASIC for hardware acceleration.
- 🐕 In 2021 I did the Google Summer of Code with BeagleBoard - [a project on accelerating calculations with help of GPGPU and OpenGL ES](https://jduchniewicz.github.io/gsoc2021-blog/)
- ⚙️ I am working on porting [BIBoP](https://github.com/JDuchniewicz/BIBoP) to [Rust](https://github.com/JDuchniewicz/RustBIBoP) - a health-band used for remote patient monitoring and overall health assessment
